There are 4 modes of transportation. These are encoded as the
edgeLayer inside the router files/transportation networks.

auto=0
metro=1
bus=2
walk=3

The NFA has 3 nodes to encode that only one auto segment is permissible.

Starting state: 0

  The NFA will remain in this state while traversing metro, bus and
  walk links. It will transition to state 1 in the case of auto.

State 1: captures that auto segment

  The NFA will remain in this state while traversing auto. It will
  transition to state 2 in the case of metro, bus and walk links.

State 2:

  The NFA will remain in this state while traversing metro, bus and
  walk links and will not accept auto travel.
